                        During my tenure at AMD, my position was focused on technical analysis at the Radeon Technologies Group performance lab, where I would collect data on products the company and their competitors released to give to the various divisions in the company. This data was used to find anomalies in new driver revisions and gather presentable data for new product releases. Most of my work was in the form of a PLS (product line summary) report where I would benchmark every graphics card on the market and compare their performance in each title with a product over product and driver over driver comparison. Since the team uses automation for their benchmarking, I would frequently maintain the scripts used for each game as game updates and new changes are needed to make sure the script runs properly and reliably. Another project I was assigned to during my tenure was to help out with the release of the Radeon RX 6600 XT graphics card. The main task I was assigned to do was to test and ensure that the graphics cards sent to reviewers would perform as expected without any defect. I manually tested each card with programs such as 3DMark Time Spy and Furmark to ensure that the temperatures, noise and performance were up to specification.

                        test the new functionality and bug fixes that the developers put out. Though the work term was
                        shorter than usual, I contributed a lot during that time as I was able to test over 100 test
                        cases for a few different projects. One notable project was testing the changes for Fedex's
                        photo stations when EFI converted their network from on-site (EPPhoto2) to AWS (SSAC). I also
                        gained some hands-on experience with EFI’s hardware, specifically the M500 and M600 series
                        kiosks. I was shown how the device was configured and how to service and retrofit different
                        components on the device.

                        my work includes setting up devices for new employees, troubleshooting problems on employee
                        devices, test new application updates/revisions and document the behavior, and deploy
                        peripherals in the office or to the employee’s home. Halfway through the work term, the Atria
                        office had closed for all non-essential workers due to COVID-19, and I chose to continue my work
                        term to help out with the rest of the OSS team in the GTA by myself at the Atria office.

                        run a camp of 60 kids aged 6 to 12 by organizing games and events throughout the entire summer.
                        The second summer, I was relocated to the counsellor-in-training camp, where I would teach a
                        group of teenagers, aged 13 to 16, the rules and protocols followed by staff and grade their
                        performance during their placement at a camp.
